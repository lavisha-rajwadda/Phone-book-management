Introduction 

       Managing contact information efficiently is an essential aspect of personal and professional communication. With the increasing reliance on digital tools, having a simple yet effective solution for storing and retrieving contact details has become highly valuable.

This project introduces a desktop-based Phone Book Application developed using Python and the Tkinter library. The application enables users to input, store, and sort contact names along with their phone numbers. A built-in Quick Sort algorithm is used to arrange the contacts alphabetically, enhancing the usability of the system. The interface also features input validation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of stored data.

The user-friendly GUI, designed with Tkinter, allows for easy data entry and provides immediate feedback through dialog messages. A scrollable text area is used to display the stored contact list, making navigation simple and efficient.

This tool serves as a practical solution for managing personal contacts without the need for external databases or complex configurations. It demonstrates the effectiveness of combining Python programming, GUI design, and algorithmic logic to solve real-world problems.

The primary goal is to develop an intuitive and functional contact management system that provides users with a seamless experience while reinforcing core programming concepts in a real-world application.
